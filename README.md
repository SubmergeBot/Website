# Submerge Website

Built with TypeScript, Sass, and Webpack. Uses JavaScript for offline browsing
and client-side navigation, trying to support some older browsers by using XHR
and LocalStorage when Fetch and Service Workers aren't available. The rest of
the site is plain old HTML with (hopefully) little to no bloat.

## To-do still

- [ ] footer
- [ ] nav bar
- [ ] docs
- [ ] some sort of dashboard?
- [ ] Cache API caching method (without ServiceWorker)
- [ ] Detect cellular network and prompt before downloading site
- [ ] A way to opt out of caching
